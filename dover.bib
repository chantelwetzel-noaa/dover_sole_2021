	abstract = {Fisheries scientists provide stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments to support interdisplinary fisheries management in the US and worldwide. These assessment activities have evolved different models, using different review standards, and are communicated using different vocabulary. Recent research shows that spatio-temporal models can estimate population density for multiple locations, times, and species, and that this is a “common currency” for addressing core goals in stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments. I therefore review the history and “design principles” for one spatio-temporal modelling package, the Vector Autoregressive SpatioTemporal (VAST) package. I then provide guidance on fifteen major decisions that must be made by users of VAST, including: whether to use a univariate or multivariate model; when to include spatial and/or spatiotemporal variation; how many factors to use within a multivariate model; whether to include density or catchability covariates; and when to include a temporal correlation on model components. I finally demonstrate these decisions using three case studies. The first develops indices of abundance, distribution shift, and range expansion for arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias) in the Eastern Bering Sea, showing the range expansion for this species. The second involves “species ordination” of eight groundfishes in the Gulf of Alaska bottom trawl survey, which highlights the different spatial distribution of flathead sole (Hippoglossoides elassodon) relative to sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) and dover sole (Microstomus pacificus). The third involves a short-term forecast of the proportion of coastwide abundance for five groundfishes within three spatial strata in the US West Coast groundfish bottom trawl survey, and predicts large interannual variability (and high uncertainty) in the distribution of lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus). I conclude by recommending further research exploring the benefits and limitations of a “common currency” approach to stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments, and discuss extending this approach to optimal survey design and economic assessments.},

	abstract = {Bathymetry is a key element in the demography of Dover sole Microstomus pacificus. Juvenile Dover soles begin life in relatively shallow water on the continental shelf but move gradually down the continental slope into deeper water as they grow and reach sexual maturity. Large and old individuals may eventually reach depths greater than 1,500 m. The ontogenetic migration of Dover soles into deeper water gives rise to a general pattern of increasing fish size with water depth, but there are differences between sexes and locations. To describe these patterns in greater detail, we computed probability distributions for depth, length, and sex using research trawl data for Dover sole taken off central California and Oregon. Our results indicate that females live at greater depths than do males and that abundance of large Dover soles may be lower at depths where lowest oxygen concentrations occur. In addition, major differences in bathymetric demography exist between study sites due, we suggest, to differences in bottom topography. We used one group of probability distributionsand logbook data for Oregon and central California in a simple model to demonstrate how depth of fishing and bathymelric demography complicate interpretation of length composition and other data from a commercial fishery. Results from the model indicate that depth-stratified assessment models may be required to interpret fisheries data for Dover sole and other species, like shortspine thornyhead Sebasto/obus alascanus and sablefish Anoplopoma fimbria, that undergo ontogenetic migration from shallow into deep water.},

Six sites were sampled in three primary biogeographical provinces (based on surface water temperatures), ranging from the subarctic to the warm temperate zones. Many haplotypes were discerned, totalling 90 for 110 individuals. Neighbour joining and parsimony analyses of the entire data set showed that some groups of haplotypes of adult Dover sole were widely distributed, suggesting either panmixia or homoplasy and reversals. However, a substantial number of groups of related haplotypes were geographically circumscribed, and there were signiﬁcant differences among sites in the distribution of restricted haplotypes (based on a reduced number of characters), supporting geographical structure. Geographical differentiation of populations appeared to be consistent with the member-vagrant hypothesis for retention of the pelagic larvae in currents and recruitment to adult habitats, reducing long-distance dispersal. Results of this study indicate phylogeographical structure among some populations, despite extended pelagic larval periods, and apparent environmental homogeneity in the adult habitats along the continental slope.},

	abstract = {A major clam ﬁshery in the USA is based on the Atlantic surfclam (Spisula solidissima) and ocean quahog (Arctica islandica). For stock assessment, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) has conducted surveys of these species with a standardized hydraulic clam dredge since 1980. The sampling procedure has been to tow the dredge for 5 min at 0.77 m/s (i.e., 1.5 kn), which gives a nominal tow distance of 232 m. This indirect calculation does not include any sampling that may take place when the dredge is being set out or retrieved. To get a direct estimate of distance sampled, we placed sensors and a camera on the dredge to monitor bottom contact and towing speed. A total of 70 tows was made in May 1997 across a range of depths, typical of those made during clam surveys, and at a range of tow speeds and scopes (i.e., ratio of tow line length to bottom depth). For each tow, we counted the number of clams captured and estimated the distance sampled based directly on the sensor data. Actual distance sampled per tow was often 1.5–3 times greater than the nominal distance (timed tow), and tow distance increased with water depth. This occurred because the dredge sampled the bottom when it was being set out and hauled back to the ship. Consideration of actual tow distance changed conclusions regarding the effect of scope on catch rate of surfclams. In addition, data on tow distance and catch per tow allowed us to examine the spatial heterogeneity of the two clam species using a negative binomial model. Our ﬁndings suggest that estimating tow distances directly can improve estimates of biomass in clam resource surveys. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

            Numerous trawl hauls, made during the triennial bottom trawl surveys (1977–1998) conducted by the National Marine Fisheries Service off the U.S. West Coast, had unusually small catch rates of benthic fish and invertebrates (cpueB), probably because the trawl failed to contact the seabed (off-bottom). Technological advances in the equipment used to monitor trawl performance since 1986 have increased our ability to recognize off-bottom tows, and cpueB has risen. As direct trawl performance measurements were not available in earlier surveys, a minimum cpueB derived from the survey with the best monitoring of bottom contact of the time-series (1998) was used as a criterion to eliminate trawls with poor bottom contact from earlier surveys. The truncated data sets produce significantly larger biomass indices, especially in 1980, with increases of 43, 45, and 56\% for Dover sole, petrale sole, and Pacific sanddab, respectively. The analysis suggests that changes in cpueB over the time-series may be related more to changing survey fishing methods than to changes in abundance. Other bottom trawl surveys, which have also added trawl monitoring equipment during their time-series, may have experienced similar changes in trawl performance.},

	abstract = {Identifying juvenile habitats is critical for understanding a species’ ecology and for focusing spatial fishery management by defining references like essential fish habitat (EFH). Here, we used vector autoregressive spatio-temporal models (VAST) to delineate spatial and temporal patterns in juvenile density for 13 commercially important species of groundfishes off the US west coast. In particular, we identified hotspots with high juvenile density. Three qualitative patterns of distribution and abundance emerged. First, Dover sole Microstomus pacificus, Pacific grenadier Coryphaenoides acrolepis, shortspine thornyhead Sebastolobus alascanus, and splitnose rockfish Sebastes diploproa had distinct, spatially-limited hotspots that were spatially consistent through time. Next, Pacific hake Merluccius productus and darkblotched rockfish Sebastes crameri had distinct, spatially limited hotspots, but the location of these hotspots varied through time. Finally, arrowtooth flounder Atheresthes stomias, English sole Parophrys vetulus, sablefish Anoplopoma fimbria, Pacific grenadier Coryphaenoides acrolepis, lingcod Ophiodon elongatus, longspine thornyhead Sebastolobus altivelis, petrale sole Eopsetta jordani, and Pacific sanddab Citharichthys sordidus had large hotspots that spanned a broad latitudinal range. These habitats represent potential, if not likely, nursery areas, the location of which will inform spatial management.},

	abstract = {The Climate Forcing and Marine Ecosystem (CFAME) Task Team of the North Paciﬁc Marine Science Organization (PICES) was formed to address climate forcing impacts on ecosystem structure and productivity of marine species. For the California Current system, the Task Team described the physical processes, built an overview of species across trophic levels, and described how the population dynamics of these species have changed over time. Based on the synthesis work, conceptual models were developed describing the potential pathways linking climate forcing, oceanography, and species’ responses. The resultant empirical data scenarios draw on ecosystem histories to provide a synopsis of expected change given global climate change. The multidisciplinary team faced challenges and limitations in their attempt to draw connections between the outputs from global climate models (GCMs), the physical processes, and the subsequent impacts on species via the identiﬁed pathways. To some degree, there was a mismatch of variables that ﬁshery scientists identiﬁed as important in determining species’ response to climate and physical forcing and the variables that current GCMs can now resolve at the regional level. These gaps will be important for researchers to consider as they begin to develop higherresolution climate and regional oceanographic models for forecasting changes in species’ productivity.},

	abstract = {Settlement timing, distribution, and abundance of Dover sole (Microstomus pacificus) were compared with depth and environmental variables off Oregon, U.S.A. Surveys were made every 2 months from January to November 1989 on three 50–400 m depth transects and every March from 1990 to 1994 on one transect. Annual March age-1 catch per unit effort (CPUE) estimates did not support Hayman and Tyler’s (R.A Hayman and A. Tyler. 1980. Trans. Am. Fish. Soc. 109: 54–70) hypothesis that strong year-classes are associated with offshore convergence during the settlement season, despite a similar distribution of oceanographic conditions during the two studies. High March CPUE was correlated with high bottom temperature in the primary nursery area (100–119 m depth) and an increase in the proportion of larvae in deeper strata. Seasonal and annual observations support Hayman and Tyler’s assumption that the primary postsettlement nursery area is bathymetrically restricted. Otolith increments indicated that larvae at 50–159 m had been on the bottom longer than larvae from greater depths, suggesting postsettlement inshore migration. Sediment size and bottom temperature do not explain the high CPUE in the primary nursery area. A negative size–depth relationship and a change in depth distribution with increasing density suggest that biological interactions may influence the spring distribution.},

## Model Structure and Assumptions

### Modeling Platform and Structure

The STAT team used Stock Synthesis version 3.30.16 developed by Dr. Richard Methot at the NWFSC [@methot_stock_2013]. This most recent version was used because it included improvements and corrections to older model versions.  The previous assessment of `r spp` also used Stock Synthesis but an earlier version, 3.21f; model bridging was performed between both versions of Stock Synthesis and are shown discussed below.  The R package [r4ss](https://github.com/r4ss/r4ss), version 1.38.0, along with R version 4.0.1 were used to investigate and plot model fits. 

### Model Selection and Evaluation

The base assessment model for `r spp` was developed to balance parsimony and realism, and the goal was to estimate a spawning output trajectory for the population of `r spp` off the west coast of the U.S. The model contains many assumptions to achieve parsimony and uses many different sources of data to estimate reality. A series of investigative model runs were done to achieve the final base model.

### Model Changes from the Last Assessment 

The assessment model structure was similar to that used in 2011 but there were a few meaningful changes to the model structure.  

First, in 2011 the options for estimating sex-specific selectivity were more restrictive than those available for use in this assessment.  The assessment estimated sex-specific selectivity for all fishery and survey fleets in the model where the either female or male selectivity parameters are full offsets from the base sex selectivity parameters.  In contrast, the option used in the 2011 assessment allowed for offset sex-selectivity estimation, however, the scaling of selectivity by sex were linked. Male `r spp` were generally determined to have a higher selectivity likely due their depth distribution compared to females so both fishery fleets and the \gls{s-tri} and \gls{s-wcgbt} parameterized males as the base selectivity with female selectivity as full offsets from the males.  Both the \gls{s-nwslope} and the \gls{s-aslope} that observed a higher frequency of females compared to the other data sources, likely related to the deep water sampling design of these surveys, assumed full asymptotic female selectivity and estimate male selectivity as offsets.

### Bridging Analysis

The exploration of models began by bridging from the 2011 assessment to Stock Synthesis version 3.30.16, which produced minor differences in scale but similar is status (Figures \ref{fig:bridge-ssb} and \ref{fig:bridge-depl}). The data bridging process, where data were updated through 2010, were updated in a stepwise additive fashion where the fleet structure was modified (e.g. change to two fleets compared to three state specific fleets used in 2011), catches, indices, discard rates and mean weights, lengths and ages were updated in that order. The estimated stock scale dropped relative to the 2011 bridge model when the fleet structure was revised, declined further when discard rates were updated, but increased when lengths and ages were updated with the final scale and status simalar to the 2011 model (Figures \ref{fig:data-bridge-ssb} and \ref{fig:data-bridge-depl}). 

The next step in the model bridging analysis was to update all data sources through 2020 and apply current data weighting methods. The catches, indices, lengths, ages, and discard data (rates, mean weights, and discarded length observations) through 2020 were all added to the model in an additive stepwise fashion. The length and age data for the California fleet reflect the data available in PacFIN because CALCOM data used in the final model were not available at the time. The estimated spawning output had large fluctuations, below and above the 2011 estimated time series, based on each updated data set (Figure \ref{fig:all-data-bridge-ssb}). The estimated relative stock status across models ended up with similar final estimates in the final model year, `r endyr + 1` (Figure \ref{fig:all-data-bridge-depl}), although showed alternative trajectory patterns during the interim years.

The final step in the model bridging evaluated the impact of updated biological parameter starting values, updated prior value for natural mortality, switching to estimating male biological parameters as offsets from females, and updating all fishery and survey selectivity parameterization using the double-normal selectivity pattern with females estimated as offsets from males.  All changes were done in an additive fashion.  Updating the starting biological parameters and prior for natural mortality resulted in limited changes in the model relative to the "Update-2020 All Data" model (Figures \ref{fig:structure-bridge-ssb} and \ref{fig:structure-bridge-depl}). Switching to estimate male biological parameters as offset from the female parameters resulted in a down-ward shift in the estimated scale of the stock. The 2011 assessment noted challanges of estimating sex-specific natural mortality given the complexity of sex-specific selectivity, however, noted that the relative natural mortality values was better informed.  Early modeling was done using biological offset estimation with the aim of improving sex-specific biological estimates.  The final model bridging comparison updated the parameterization of sex-specific selectivity resulted in a significant decrease in the uncertainty of stock scale resulting in a large decrease in the estimated stock scale and the relative stock status more depleted compared to previous model updates (Figure \ref{fig:structure-bridge-ssb} and \ref{fig:structure-bridge-depl}).
The selectivity form used in this model bridging reflects the initial parameterization with females estimated as offsets for all fleets and full female selectivity being less the 1.0. The final model was updated from this initial parameter structure based on numerous model exploration but this comparisons shows the general impact of the initial switch to the new selectivity assumptions.


### Model Parameters

There were XXX estimated parameters in the base model. These included one parameter for $R_0$, XX parameters for growth, X parameters for extra variability for the survey indices, XX parameters for selectivity, retention, and time blocking of the fleets and the surveys, XX recruitment deviations, and 12 forecast recruitment deviations (Table XX).

Fixed parameters in the model were as follows. Steepness was fixed at 0.80, the mean of the prior. A sensitivity analysis and a likelihood profile were performed for steepness. Natural mortality was fixed at
0.108 yr-1 for females and males, which is the median of the prior. The standard deviation of recruitment deviates was fixed at 0.40. Maturity-at-length was fixed as described above in [Maturation and Fecundity](#maturation-and-fecundity) section.Length-weight parameters were fixed at estimates using all length-weight observations (Figure \ref{fig:est-len-wght}).

Dome-shaped selectivity was explored for all fleets within the model. Older `r spp`, particularly females, are often found in deeper waters and may move into areas that limit their availability to fishing gear. 


### Key Assumptions and Structural Choices

ADD OTHER STRUCTURE INFORMATION

Time blocks on selectivity and retention parameters were used to allow for shifts in selectivity and retention curves. Time blocks for the peak of the selectivity parameter for the California and Oregon-Washington fleet were `r startyr` – 1984, 1985 – 1995, and 1996 – `r endyr + 1`. These blocks were based on what seemed to be large scale management changes to the DTS fishery, but were also influenced by choices in early `r spp` assessments [@sampson_status_2005; @hicks_status_2011]. Time blocks for the fishery retention in Oregon-Washington were `r startyr` – 1988, 1989 – 2003, 2004 – 2010, and 2011 - `r endyr + 1`. California did not have as much historical discard data, thus the time blocks on retention for this fleet were defined as `r startyr` – 2003, 2004 - 2010, 2011 - 2014, and 2015 - `r endyr+1`. The 2011 - 2014 retention block for the California fleet was based on discard rates and lengths from WCGOP which reflected changes between the early IFQ and recent years.


### Priors

Priors were applied only to parameters for steepness ($h$) and natural mortality ($M$). The steepness prior is based on the Myers [-@myers_maximum_1999] meta-analysis of flatfish steepness and the natural mortality prior is based on a meta-analysis completed by Hamel [-@hamel_method_2015]. The prior for steepness assumed a beta distribution with a mean equal to 0.80 (Figure \ref{fig:h-prior}). 

The prior distribution for natural mortality was based on the Hamel [-@hamel_method_2015] meta-analytic approach with  an assumed maximum age of 60 years for both males and females. The prior assumed a log normal distribution for natural mortality. The log normal prior has a median of 0.09 and a standard error of 0.438. 


### Data Weighting

Length and age-at-length compositions from the \gls{s-wcgbt} and \gls{s-nwslope}  were fit along with length and marginal age compositions from the fishery and other survey fleets. Length and marginal age data started with a sample size determined from the equation listed in [Commercial Fishery Length and Age Data](#commercial-fishery-length-and-age-data) sectionfor both fishing fleets in the model. Input sample sizes for survey length data were calculcated according according the method described in [\gls{s-wcgbt}](#nwfsc-west-coast-groundfish-bottom-trawl-survey) section.  It was assumed for age-at-length data that each age was a random sample within the length bin and the model started with a sample size equal to the number of fish in that length bin.

Extra variability parameters were estimated and added to the input variance for the indices of abundance for three surveys in the model; 1) \gls{s-tri}, 2) \gls{s-nwslope}, and 3) \gls{s-aslope}. Estimating additional variance for the \gls{s-wcgbt} was explored and determined to not be required. WCGOP discard rate data during the pre-ITQ period (prior to 2011) were bootstrapped to provide uncertainty of the total discards.

The base assessment model was weighted using the “Francis method”, which was based on equation TA1.8 in Francis [@francis_data_2011]. This formulation looks at the mean length or age and the variance of the mean to determine if across years, the variability is explained by the model. If the variability around the mean does not encompass the model predictions, then that data source should be down-weighted. This method accounts for correlation in the data (i.e., the multinomial distribution).  Sensitivities were performed examining the difference between the McAllister and Ianelli [@mcallister_bayesian_1997] method (Harmonic Mean weighting) and and the Dirichlet Multinomial Weighting [-@thorson_model-based_2017]  approaches. The weights applied to each length and age data set for the base model are shown in Table XX.

## Model Structure and Assumptions

### Modeling Platform and Structure

The STAT team used Stock Synthesis version 3.30.16 developed by Dr. Richard Methot at the NOAA, NWFSC [@methot_stock_2013]. This most recent version was used because it included improvements and corrections to older model versions.  The previous assessment of `r spp` also used Stock Synthesis but an earlier version, 3.21f; model bridging was performed between both versions of Stock Synthesis and are shown discussed below.  The R package [r4ss](https://github.com/r4ss/r4ss), version 1.38.0, along with R version 4.0.1 were used to investigate and plot model fits. 

### Model Selection and Evaluation

The base assessment model for `r spp` was developed to balance parsimony and realism, and the goal was to estimate a spawning output trajectory for the population of `r spp` off the west coast of the U.S. The model contains many assumptions to achieve parsimony and uses many different sources of data to estimate reality. A series of investigative model runs were done to achieve the final base model.

### Model Changes from the Last Assessment 

The assessment model structure was similar to that used in 2011 but there were a few meaningful changes to the model structure.  

First, in 2011 the options for estimating sex-specific selectivity were more restrictive than those available for use in this assessment.  The assessment estimated sex-specific selectivity for all fishery and survey fleets in the model where the either female or male selectivity parameters are full offsets from the base sex selectivity parameters.  In contrast, the option used in the 2011 assessment allowed for offset sex-selectivity estimation, however, the scaling of selectivity by sex were linked. Male `r spp` were generally determined to have a higher selectivity likely due their depth distribution compared to females so both fishery fleets and the \gls{s-tri} and \gls{s-wcgbt} parameterized males as the base selectivity with female selectivity as full offsets from the males. After model exploration selectivity from both slope surveys, \gls{s-nwslope} and \gls{s-aslope}, were model using a cubic spline selectivity form, same as was done in the 2011 assessment. The use of the cubic spline selectivity allowed better fits to the length composition data which appeared to have bimodality across female `r spp` sampled. Both of these surveys observed a higher frequency of females compared to the other data sources, likely related to the deep water sampling design of these surveys, and male selectivity was estimated relative to female selectivity (e.g., estimated via dogleg parameterization where two parameters estimate the relative difference in log-space for male selectivity).   

This assessment simplified the fleet structure by collapsing data and catches from Oregon and Washington into a single fleet. Vessels fishing out of Oregon and Washington often fish across state lines where the landed state port may not accurately reflect the area of removals. During the pre-assessement data webinar state representatives from WDFW and ODFW supported the aggregation of data from these states into a single fishing fleet within the model.  

Biological offsets

Data weighting approaches and application have evolved considerably since 2011 when the last assessment of `r spp` was conducted. Currently, there are three alternative approaches for data weighting that are been approved for West Coast groundfish stock assessments: 1) Francis method, 2) McAllister-Ianelli Harmonic Mean method, or 3) Dirichlet-Multinomial method. The base  model was weighted using the "Francis method", which was based on equation TA1.8 in Francis [-@francis_data_2011]. This formulation looks at the mean length or age and the variance of the mean to determine if across years, the variability is explained by the model. If the variability around the mean does not encompass the model predictions, then that data source should be down-weighted. This method accounts for correlation in the data (i.e., the multinomial distribution).  Sensitivities were performed examining the difference in weighting using McAllister-Ianelli Harmonic Mean Weighting [-@mcallister_bayesian_1997] and the Dirichlet Multinomial Weighting [-@thorson_model-based_2017].

### Bridging Analysis

The exploration of models began by bridging from the 2011 assessment to Stock Synthesis version 3.30.16, which produced minor differences in scale but similar is status (Figures \ref{fig:bridge-ssb} and \ref{fig:bridge-depl}). The data bridging process, where data were updated through 2010, were updated in a step-wise additive fashion where the fleet structure was modified (e.g. change to two fleets compared to three state specific fleets used in 2011), catches, indices, discard rates and mean weights, lengths and ages were updated in that order. The estimated stock scale dropped relative to the 2011 bridge model when the fleet structure was revised, declined further when discard rates were updated, but increased when lengths and ages were updated with the final scale and status similar to the 2011 model (Figures \ref{fig:data-bridge-ssb} and \ref{fig:data-bridge-depl}). 

The next step in the model bridging analysis was to update all data sources through 2020 and apply current data weighting methods. The catches, indices, lengths, ages, and discard data (rates, mean weights, and discarded length observations) through 2020 were all added to the model in an additive step-wise fashion. The length and age data for the California fleet reflect the data available in PacFIN because CALCOM data used in the final model were not available at the time. The estimated spawning output had large fluctuations, below and above the 2011 estimated time series, based on each updated data set (Figure \ref{fig:all-data-bridge-ssb}). The estimated relative stock status across models ended up with similar final estimates in the final model year, `r endyr + 1` (Figure \ref{fig:all-data-bridge-depl}), although showed alternative trajectory patterns during the interim years.

The final step in the model bridging evaluated the impact of updated biological parameter starting values, updated prior value for natural mortality, switching to estimating male biological parameters as offsets from females, and updating all fishery and survey selectivity parameterization using the double-normal selectivity pattern with females estimated as offsets from males.  All changes were done in an additive fashion.  Updating the starting biological parameters and prior for natural mortality resulted in limited changes in the model relative to the "Update - 2020 All Data" model (Figures \ref{fig:structure-bridge-ssb} and \ref{fig:structure-bridge-depl}). Switching to estimate male biological parameters as offset from the female parameters resulted in a down-ward shift in the estimated scale of the stock. The 2011 assessment noted challenges of estimating sex-specific natural mortality given the complexity of sex-specific selectivity, however, noted that the relative natural mortality values was better informed.  Early modeling was done using biological offset estimation with the aim of improving sex-specific biological estimates.  The final model bridging comparison updated the parameterization of sex-specific selectivity resulted in a significant decrease in the uncertainty of stock scale resulting in a large decrease in the estimated stock scale and the relative stock status more depleted compared to previous model updates (Figure \ref{fig:structure-bridge-ssb} and \ref{fig:structure-bridge-depl}). The selectivity form used in this model bridging reflects the initial parameterization with females estimated as offsets for all fleets and full female selectivity being less the 1.0. The final model was updated from this initial parameter structure based on numerous model exploration but this comparisons shows the general impact of the initial switch to the new selectivity assumptions.


### Key Assumptions and Structural Choices

The specifications of the assessment are listed in Table \ref{tab:model-structure}. The model is a two-sex, age-structured model starting in `r startyr	` with an accumulated age group at 60 years. Growth and natural mortality were assumed time invariant with a constant growth estimated and **natural mortality fixed** at the median of the prior. The lengths in the population were tracked by 1 cm intervals and the length data were binned into 2 cm intervals. 

Time blocks on selectivity and retention parameters were used to allow for shifts in selectivity and retention curves. Time blocks for the peak of the selectivity parameter for the California and Oregon-Washington fleet were `r startyr` - 1984, 1985 - 1995, and 1996 - `r endyr + 1`. These blocks were based on what seemed to be large scale management changes to the DTS fishery, but were also influenced by choices in early `r spp` assessments [@sampson_status_2005; @hicks_status_2011]. Time blocks for the fishery retention in Oregon-Washington were `r startyr` - 1988, 1989 - 2003, 2004 - 2010, and 2011 - `r endyr + 1`. California did not have as much historical discard data, thus the time blocks on retention for this fleet were defined as `r startyr` - 2003, 2004 - 2010, 2011 - 2014, and 2015 - `r endyr+1`. The 2011 - 2014 retention block for the California fleet was based on discard rates and lengths from WCGOP which reflected changes between the early IFQ and recent years.

The specification of when to estimate recruitment deviations is an assumption that likely affects model uncertainty. Recruitment deviations were estimated from 1880 - 2018 to appropriately quantify uncertainty. The earliest length-composition data occur in 1967 and the earliest age data were in 1981. The most informed years for estimating recruitment deviations were from about the mid-1990 to 2014. The period from 1880 - 1974 was fit using an early series with little or no bias adjustment, the main period of recruitment deviates occurred from 1975 - 2018 with an upward and downward ramping of bias adjustment, and 2019 onward were fit using forecast recruitment deviates with no bias adjustment. Methot and Taylor [-@methot_adjusting_2011] summarize the reasoning behind varying levels of bias adjustment based on the information available to estimate the deviates. The standard deviation of recruitment variability was assumed to be `r model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "SR_sigmaR", "Value"]` based on the estimated variation in recruitment from the base model.

The following distributions were assumed for data fitting: survey indices were lognormal, total discards were a t-distribution with 30 degrees of freedom, and the compositional data had a multinomial error structure.


### Priors

Priors were applied only to parameters for steepness ($h$) and natural mortality ($M$). The steepness prior is based on the Myers [-@myers_maximum_1999] meta-analysis of flatfish steepness and the natural mortality prior is based on a meta-analysis completed by Hamel [-@hamel_method_2015]. The prior for steepness assumed a beta distribution with a mean equal to 0.80 (Figure \ref{fig:h-prior}). 

The prior distribution for natural mortality was based on the Hamel [-@hamel_method_2015] meta-analytic approach with  an assumed maximum age of 60 years for both males and females. The prior assumed a log normal distribution for natural mortality. The log normal prior has a median of 0.09 and a standard error of 0.438. 


### Data Weighting

Length and age-at-length compositions from the \gls{s-wcgbt} and \gls{s-nwslope}  were fit along with length and marginal age compositions from the fishery and other survey fleets. Length and marginal age data started with a sample size determined from the equation listed in Section \ref{commercial-fishery-length-and-age-data} for both fishing fleets in the model. Input sample sizes for survey length data were calculated according according the method described in Section \ref{nwfsc-wcgbt}.  It was assumed for age-at-length data that each age was a random sample within the length bin and the model started with a sample size equal to the number of fish in that length bin.

Extra variability parameters were estimated and added to the input variance for the indices of abundance for three surveys in the model; 1) \gls{s-tri}, 2) \gls{s-nwslope}, and 3) \gls{s-aslope}. Estimating additional variance for the \gls{s-wcgbt} was explored and determined to not be required. WCGOP discard rate data during the pre-ITQ period (prior to 2011) were bootstrapped to provide uncertainty of the total discards.

The base assessment model was weighted using the Francis method, which was based on equation TA1.8 in Francis [@francis_data_2011]. Sensitivities were performed examining the difference between the McAllister and Ianelli [@mcallister_bayesian_1997] method (Harmonic Mean weighting) and and the Dirichlet Multinomial Weighting [-@thorson_model-based_2017]  approaches. The weights applied to each length and age data set for the base model are shown in Table XX.


### Estimated and Fixed Parameters

There were 231 estimated parameters in the base model. These included one parameter for $R_0$, 10 parameters for growth, 3 parameters for extra variability for the survey indices, 64 parameters for selectivity, retention, and time blocking of the fleets and the surveys, 141 recruitment deviations, and 12 forecast recruitment deviations (Table \ref{tab:params}).

Fixed parameters in the model were as follows. Steepness was fixed at 0.80, the mean of the prior. A sensitivity analysis and a likelihood profile were performed for steepness. **Natural mortality was fixed at 0.108 yr-1 for females and males**, which is the median of the prior. The standard deviation of recruitment deviates was fixed at 0.40. Maturity-at-length was fixed as described above in Section \ref{maturation-and-fecundity}. Length-weight parameters were fixed at external estimates based on all available survey length-weight observations (Figure \ref{fig:est-len-wght}).

Sex-specific and dome-shaped selectivity was explored for all fleets within the model. Older `r spp`, particularly females, are often found in deeper waters and may move into areas that limit their availability to fishing gear.

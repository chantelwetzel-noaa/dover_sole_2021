Ecosytem factors have not been explicitly modeled in this assessment but there are several aspects of the California current ecosystem that may impact `r spp` population dynamics and warrant further research. Survival of `r spp` eggs and pelagic larvae that have a protracted pelagic phase are linked to water circulation patterns [@king_climate_2011]. The timing of settlement occurs typically between January and March and is correlated with Ekman transport, positive vertical velocity and relatively warm bottom temperatures [@toole_settlement_1997].  Markle et al. [-@markle_metamorphosis_1992] hypothesized that juvenile `r spp` move inshore to nursery habitat by making vertical ascents during the night off bottom until they encounter suitable habitat.  Tolimieri et al. [-@tolimieri_spatio-temporal_2020] identified multiple areas off the coast of southern California that had high densities of young `r spp`. This is consistent with the finding of Toole et al. [-@toole_seasonal_2011] that juvenile `r spp` 10 - 22 cm tended to move inshore during summer months. As `r spp` age they generally move offshore into deep waters. Changing water temperature due to climate change may alter the winter onshore Ekman transport which could have impacts on juvenile survival, result in distributional shifts of favorable spawning grounds, or nursery habitats of `r spp`.

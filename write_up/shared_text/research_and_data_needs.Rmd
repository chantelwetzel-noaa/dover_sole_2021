Investigating and or addressing the following items could improve future assessments of `r spp`: 

\begin{itemize}

\item Spatiotemporal distribution patterns with depth:  There are patterns of length and sex ratios with depth which may indicate that the stock is more complex than currently modeled.  Further research into the causes of these patterns as well as differences between seasons would help with understanding the stock characteristics such that a more realistic model could be built.  This may also provide further insight into migration and help determine if there are localized populations.

\item Stock boundaries: A common question in stock assessments is whether or not the entire stock is being represented. `r spp` live deeper than the range of the fisheries and surveys.  The assessment model attempts to account for out of area biomass through catchability coefficients and selectivity curves, but that portion of the stock is unknown and can only be conjectured.  Research into abundance in deep areas would be useful to verify that the assessment adequately predicts the entire spawning stock of `r spp`.

\item Unavailable biomass: The distribution of `r spp` covers a wide-depth range off the West Coast. `r spp` are observed by the \gls{s-wcgbt} out to 1,280 m, the maximum depth sampled, where the majority of `r spp` observations at these depths are females. The sex-specific movement of `r spp` across depths results in the model estimating that females` are never fully selected (maximum selectivity well below 1.0 or dome-shaped) by the fisheries or the surveys. This results in an assumption that there is some portion of cryptic biomass that is unavailable for selection by the fisheries or observation by the surveys.  Improved understanding about sex-specific availability across depths by season and the proportion of `r spp` biomass, particularly female biomass, at depths beyond the range of the survey would improve future estimates of stock size. 

\item California Sampling for Ages: Since 1990, nearly 60 percent of fish aged have been landed at the Crescent City port with some years all aged fish being landed there. In contrast, the majority of `r spp` landed in California occur at the Eureka port (approximately 67 percent over the last 10 years). Ensuring that sampling is spread across California ports and otoliths selected for ageing are spread across ports proportional to area removals may provide additional insights to area-specific population attributes.

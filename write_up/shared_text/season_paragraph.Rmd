The water depths being fished by the trawl fleet varies based on the season (deeper or shallower in summer or winter months) and the targetting of specific co-occuring species (e.g., sablefish or petrale sole). If `r spp` are moving onto and off of the shelf by season for biological reasons (e.g., spawning), this could result in distinct differences in the fish available to the fishery by season. However, there are non-trivial challenges in splitting historical data (e.g., data prior to 1981) to finer resolutions. Additionally, the current parameterization of selectivity is fairly complex and creating additional fleets in the model would require an increase in parameter with reduced data quantities to inform parameter estimates.

The base case model was developed with the goal of balancing parsimony with realism and fitting the data.  There were, however, some pieces of data that were fit poorly.  Specifically, the commercial length and age data for the combined Washington/Oregon fleet showed some unsatisfactory patterns in the early years of data. It is uncertain if these patterns are related to a lack of fit due to retention curves, selectivity curves, issues with historic data collection, or growth.  It is possible that `r spp` exhibit different life-history patterns in the north and the model is unable to capture these differences without introducing additional complexity.

Add other uncertainties - natural mortality

`r spp` life-history parameters exhibit strong relationships with depth that indicate the stock is more complex than the model assumes.  Small fish are found in shallow water, while mid-sized and larger fish are found in middle and deeper depths.  There is not a trend of larger fish being found deeper, but there is a trend of fewer smaller fish found deeper.  In addition, there is a pattern of sex ratio by depth with more males found in middle depths and more females found in shallow and deeper depths.  These patterns are apparent in the summer fisheries and surveys.  It is uncertain how the patterns affect the data (they may be a cause of the bimodal length distributions seen in the slope surveys) and if these patterns can be effectively modeled to produce better fits to the data and better predictions of biomass.

The base case model was developed with the goal of balancing parsimony with realism and fitting the data. To achieve parsimony some simplification of model structure was assumed which may impact the interprettation and fit to specific data sets. The maturity-at-length or -at-age analysis conducted for this assessment and the length-at-age estimates identified possible differences in `r spp` south and north of Point Reyes. Currently, there is limited information on the movement of `r spp` by latitude or depth which would provide possible insights into the mechanisms behind these observed differences. Additionally, in recent years the majority of fishery data are arising from ports north of Point Reyes which limits the ability to support additional model complexity. Given the lack of information to inform the structure and parameterization of a spatial model, the base model opted to assume a homogenous population structure at this time. Future research into the biology and movement of `r spp` could facilite future spatial modeling efforts if appropriate. 

Uncertainty in natural mortality translates into uncertain estimates of status and sustainable fishing levels for `r spp`. In the base model, a balence between fixing and estimating this key parameter was struck by fixing female natural mortality at the median of the prior while estimating the relative difference in male natural mortality. The profile across values of female natural the likelihood supported lower values which may not have been expected _apriori_ based on the available age data.  This could be due to limited information about maximum age for `r spp` in the data, the limited selection of female `r spp` by the fisheries and surveys, or could indicate model mis-specification. It is unclear what is driving this behavior in the model. 

`r spp` life-history parameters exhibit strong relationships with depth that indicate the stock is more complex than the model assumes.  Small fish are found in shallow water, while mid-sized and larger fish are observed across all depths. Specifically, the \gls{s-wcgbt} observes some of the largest female `r spp` in waters less than 300 meters. The variability of sizes obseved by sex increases moving from deeper to shallower waters. Conversly, the median observed size by depth increases with depth. In addition, there is a pattern of sex ratio by depth with more males found in middle depths and more females found in shallow and deeper depths.  These patterns are apparent in the summer fisheries and surveys.  It is uncertain how the patterns affect the data (they may be a cause of the bimodal length distributions seen in the slope surveys) and if these patterns can be effectively modeled to produce better fits to the data and better predictions of biomass.

The base case model was developed with the goal of balancing parsimony with realism and fitting the data. To achieve parsimony some simplification of model structure was assumed which may impact the interprettation and fit to specific data sets. The maturity-at-length or -at-age analysis conducted for this assessment and the length-at-age estimates identified possible differences in `r spp` south and north of Point Reyes. Currently, there is limited information on the movement of `r spp` by latitude or depth which would provide possible insights into the mechanisms behind these observed differences. Additionally, in recent years the majority of fishery data are arising from ports north of Point Reyes which limits the ability to support additional model complexity. Given the lack of information to inform the structure and parameterization of a spatial model, the base model opted to assume a homogenous population structure at this time. Future research into the biology and movement of `r spp` could facilite future spatial modeling efforts if appropriate. 

`r spp` life-history parameters exhibit strong relationships with depth that indicate the stock is more complex than the model assumes.  Small fish are found in shallow water, while mid-sized and larger fish are observed across all depths. Specifically, the \gls{s-wcgbt} observes some of the largest female `r spp` in waters less than 300 meters. The variability of sizes obseved by sex increases moving from deeper to shallower waters. Conversly, the median observed size by depth increases with depth. In addition, there is a pattern of sex ratio by depth with more males found in middle depths and more females found in shallow and deeper depths.  These patterns are apparent in the summer fisheries and surveys.  It is uncertain how the patterns affect the data (they may be a cause of the bimodal length distributions seen in the slope surveys) and if these patterns can be effectively modeled to produce better fits to the data and better predictions of biomass.

Uncertainty in natural mortality translates into uncertain estimates of status and sustainable fishing levels for `r spp`. In the base model, a balence between fixing and estimating this key parameter was struck by fixing female natural mortality at the median of the prior while estimating the relative difference in male natural mortality. The likelihood profile across values of female natural mortality values supported lower values which may not have been expected _apriori_ based on the available age data.  Additionally, the values of catchability for the \gls{s-wcgbt} and both slope surveys were above 2.0 (the survey observed biomass was at least twice the model estimated vulnerable biomass) when natural mortality was estimated due to a drop in the population scale. The shift in low estimated natural mortality and shifts in stock scale could be due to limited information about natural mortality for `r spp` in the data, the limited selection of female `r spp` by the fisheries and surveys, or could indicate model mis-specification. It is unclear what is driving this behavior in the model.

The selectivity parameters by sex for each survey seemed to be well estimated in the base model.  However, moving to the double-normal with offset parameterization from the 2011 selectivity form  had a substantial change in the model estimates of stock size. The best fit to the length and age data is achieved with the parameterization in the base model. Both this assessment and the previous assessment estimated maximum female selectivities well below 1.0, although the current analysis estimated slightly higher maximum female selectivity values for each of the surveys. There is inherent uncertainty that may not be fully captured in the within model uncertainty when female fish who represent spawning biomass are not fully observed by any fleet.

The 2021 spawning output relative to unfished equilibrium spawning output is well above the management target of 25 percent of unfished spawning output. The fishing intensity has been below the current management harvest rate limit ($\text{SPR}_{30\%}$) across all modeled years (Figure \ref{fig:1-spr}).  The relative biomass compared to the ratio of the estimated SPR to the management target ($\text{SPR}_{30\%}$) across all model years are shown in Figure \ref{fig:phase} where warmer colors (red) represent early years and colder colors (blue) represent recent years.  The relative biomass and estimated SPR has been well above the management biomass target (25 percent) and well below the SPR target across all model years. Figure \ref{fig:yield} shows the equilibrium curve based on a steepness value fixed at `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "SR_BH_steep","Value"], 2)` with vertical dashed lines to indicate the estimate of fraction unfished at the start of `r endyr +1` (current) and the estimated management targets calculated based on the relative target biomass (B target), the SPR target, and the maximum sustainable yield (MSY).

Reference points were calculated using the estimated selectivities and catch distributions among fleets in the most recent year of the model, `r endyr` (Table \ref{tab:referenceES}). Sustainable total yield, landings plus discards, using an $SPR_{30\%}$ is `r format(model$derived_quants[model$derived_quants$Label == 'Dead_Catch_SPR', 'Value'], digits = 0, scientific = FALSE, big.mark = ',')` mt. The spawning output equivalent to 25 percent of the unfished spawning output ($\text{SB}_{25\%}$) calculated using the SPR target ($\text{SPR}_{30\%}$) was `r format(model$derived_quants[model$derived_quants$Label == 'SSB_SPR', 'Value'], digits = 0, scientific = FALSE, big.mark = ',')` millions of eggs. Recent removals have been below the point estimate of the potential long-term yields calculated using an $\text{SPR}_{30\%}$ reference point and the population scale has been relatively stable in recent years.

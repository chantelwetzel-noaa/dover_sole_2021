## Model Diagnostics

### Convergence

Proper convergence was determined by starting the minimization process from dispersed values of the maximum likelihood estimates to determine if the model found a better minimum. Starting parameters were jittered by 5 percent. This was repeated 100 times with XX out of 100 runs returned to the base model likelihood. A better, lower negative log-likelihood, model fit was not found. The model did not experience convergence issues when provided reasonable starting values. Through the jittering done as explained and likelihood profiles, we are confident that the base model as presented represents the best fit to the data given the assumptions made. There were no difficulties in inverting the Hessian to obtain estimates of variability, although much of the early model investigation was done without attempting to estimate a Hessian.

### Sensitivity Analyses

A number of sensitivity analyses were conducted.  The majority of the sensitivities conducted was a single exploration from the base model assumptions and/or data, and were not performed in a cumulative fashion.

\begin{enumerate}
   
  \item Estimate Lorenzen natural mortality ($M$) by sex with the change of $M$ occurring at approximately age-at-50-percent maturity of 10 years old.

  \item Allow the model to estimate sex-specific $M$ values.

  \item Fix $M$ values by sex equal to the estimates from the 2011 assessment of `r spp`. 

  \item Assume the 2011 length-at-maturity estimates.

  \item Mirror the selectivity by sex and retention for the CA and OR/WA fishing fleets.

  \item Assume the 2011 parameterization of fishery selectivity.

  \item Assume the 2011 parameterization of survey selectivity. 

  \item Fix the NWFSC Slope Survey female selectivity to asymptote at 1.0.  

\end{enumerate}

Likelihood values and estimates of key parameters from each sensitivity are available in Table \ref{tab:sensitivities}.  Plots of the estimated time-series of spawning biomass and relative spawning biomass are shown in Figures \ref{fig:sens-ssb} and \ref{fig:sens-depl}.

### Likelihood Profiles

Likelihood profiles were conducted for $R_0$, steepness, and female natural mortality values separately. These likelihood profiles were conducted by fixing the parameter at specific values and estimated the remaining parameters based on the fixed parameter value.

For steepness, the negative log-likelihood supported values between 0.40 - 1.0 (Figure \ref{fig:r0-profile}).  Likelihood components by data source show that the  age data from the \gls{s-wcgbt} support a lower steepness values while the length data across most fleets in the model were relatively flat.  The surveys generally provide very little information concerning steepness but tend to support higher values of steepness. The estimated spawning biomass for `r spp` diverges most at the start of the timeseries (estimates of $SB0$) and across the final 25 years of the model (Figure \ref{fig:h-ssb})  The stock was estimated to be most depleted at the end of the timeseries with lower values of steepness (Figure \ref{fig:h-depl}).

The negative log-likelihood was minimized at a female natural mortality value of 0.08 with values from 0.07 - 0.09 supported based on the total negative-log-likelihood. The profile was run under the base model assumption that male natural mortality was set equal to female natural mortality (Figure \ref{fig:m-profile}).  The length data was generally uniformative across fleets except for the \gls{s-wcgbt} that supported higher natural mortality values while the age data from this survey fleet supported lower natural mortality values.  This divergence of information by data type is commonly observed across species and the mechanisms behind this behavior is not fully understood. The stock scale and status was highly variable across natural mortality values where lower values resulted in lower stock scale and status (Figures \ref{fig:m-ssb} and \ref{fig:m-depl}).

In regards to values of $R_0$, the negative log-likelihood was minimized at approximately log($R_0$) of `r round(log(model$derived_quants[model$derived_quants$Label == "Recr_Virgin",2]),2)`  (Figure \ref{fig:r0-profile}).  The estimate of $R_0$ was informed by a relatively consistent signal from length data across fleets.  The most influential source of age data on the estimate of $R_0$ was the \gls{s-wcgbt} which supported higher values of $R_0$. 


### Retrospective Analysis

A ten-year retrospective analysis was conducted by peeling off years of data ranging from 2010 - 2019 (i.e., "Data -1 Years" corresponds to data through 2019). The estimated spawning output was generally consistent with the base model when recent years of data were removed (Figures \ref{fig:retro-ssb} and \ref{fig:retro-depl}). As data years were subsequently removed the overall stock scale declined with the largest drops in stock size and status estimates occurring after 9 or 10 years of recent data were removed.

### Historical Analysis

The estimated spawning output from previous assessments since 2001 are shown in Figure \ref{fig:past-assess}. The estimate of stock scale from the base model is considerably lower relative to the 2011 assessment estimate which was highly uncertain. The base model $SB0$ was also less than the value estimated in 2005 but was highly similar between 1960-2005. The relative stock status from the base model was between the 2011 and the 2005 estimate.  

### Unresolved Problems and Major Uncertainties

Parameter uncertainty is explicitly captured in the asymptotic confidence intervals reported throughout this assessment for key parameters and management quantities. These intervals reflect the uncertainty in the model fit to the data sources included in the assessment, but do not include uncertainty associated with alternative model configurations, weighting of data sources (a combination of input sample sizes and relative weighting of likelihood components), or fixed parameters.

There are a number of major uncertainties regarding model parameters that have been explored via sensitivity analysis. The most notable explorations involved the sensitivity of model estimates to:

\begin{enumerate}

\item The stocks rapid increase in biomass since 2010 was driven by reduced catches and three strong year-classes, 2006-2008, entering the population.  In recent years, strong recruitments in a single year have been observed leading to sharp increases in biomass in other West Coast groundfish stocks. However, the observation of three subsequent strong recruitments has not been commonly observed in other stocks and the specific mechanisms that led to these three strong-year classes are currently unknown. 

\item The value of natural mortality by sex.	Natural mortality by sex and steepness are uncertain for `r spp`.  Currently, both natural mortality and steepness are estimated within the model and are negatively correlated.  This provides information regarding these parameters combined values, but there is large uncertainty regarding the value of each parameter individually.

\item New fecundity data for `r spp` supports a fecundity relationship that differs from the current assumption (fecundity equals body weights) in this update assessment. A sensitivity to the new data results in a less optimistic estimate of relative spawning biomass, declining to 35% from the base model 39%, when the new coast-wide fecundity relationship was included in the model. The new data supports differences in fecundity estimated between `r spp` observed in the north and south off the U.S. west coast.  However, some of the contrast in estimates between the northern and southern fish may be due to sample sizes differences. The next full assessment for `r spp` will want to explore methods of how best to include the new fecundity data. 

\item Additionally, a reconstructed historical Washington catch history has not been included in the `r spp` stock assessment.  Washington state is currently undergoing efforts to determine historical catches for `r spp` and the next stock assessment is likely to incorporate these new historical catch estimates. 

\end{enumerate}

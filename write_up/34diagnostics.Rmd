## Model Diagnostics

### Convergence

Proper convergence was determined by starting the minimization process from dispersed values of the maximum likelihood estimates to determine if the model found a better minimum. Starting parameters were jittered by 5 percent. This was repeated 100 times with XX out of 100 runs returned to the base model likelihood. A better, lower negative log-likelihood, model fit was not found. The model did not experience convergence issues when provided reasonable starting values. Through the jittering done as explained and likelihood profiles, we are confident that the base model as presented represents the best fit to the data given the assumptions made. There were no difficulties in inverting the Hessian to obtain estimates of variability, although much of the early model investigation was done without attempting to estimate a Hessian.

### Sensitivity Analyses

Sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine the relative influence of specific changes to data inputs and model structural assumptions to further address uncertainty associated with the base model estimates and derived management quantities.  The majority of the sensitivity models are the result of a single change relative to base model, and .  Sensitivity models are therefore individually relative to the base model (i.e., they are not the result of cumulative changes such as the modeling approach used with the bridging analysis). Comparisons of parameter estimates from the sensitivity analysis are shown in Tables \ref{tab:sensitivities1} and \ref{tab:sensitivities2}. Many additional sensitivity runs were explored during development and testing of the base model. This section focuses on the main data and structural sensitivity model runs and includes the following:

Likelihood values and estimates of key parameters from each sensitivity are available in Table \ref{tab:sensitivities}.  Plots of the estimated time-series of spawning biomass and relative spawning biomass are shown in Figures \ref{fig:sens-ssb} and \ref{fig:sens-depl}.

### Likelihood Profiles

Likelihood profiles were conducted for $R_0$, steepness, and female natural mortality values separately. These likelihood profiles were conducted by fixing the parameter at specific values and estimated the remaining parameters based on the fixed parameter value.

For steepness, the negative log-likelihood supported values between 0.40 - 1.0 (Figure \ref{fig:r0-profile}).  Likelihood components by data source show that the  age data from the \gls{s-wcgbt} support a lower steepness values while the length data across most fleets in the model were relatively flat.  The surveys generally provide very little information concerning steepness but tend to support higher values of steepness. The estimated spawning biomass for `r spp` diverges most at the start of the timeseries (estimates of $SB0$) and across the final 25 years of the model (Figure \ref{fig:h-ssb})  The stock was estimated to be most depleted at the end of the timeseries with lower values of steepness (Figure \ref{fig:h-depl}).

The negative log-likelihood was minimized at a female natural mortality value of 0.08 with values from 0.07 - 0.09 supported based on the total negative-log-likelihood. The profile was run under the base model assumption that male natural mortality was set equal to female natural mortality (Figure \ref{fig:m-profile}).  The length data was generally uniformative across fleets except for the \gls{s-wcgbt} that supported higher natural mortality values while the age data from this survey fleet supported lower natural mortality values.  This divergence of information by data type is commonly observed across species and the mechanisms behind this behavior is not fully understood. The stock scale and status was highly variable across natural mortality values where lower values resulted in lower stock scale and status (Figures \ref{fig:m-ssb} and \ref{fig:m-depl}).

In regards to values of $R_0$, the negative log-likelihood was minimized at approximately log($R_0$) of `r round(log(model$derived_quants[model$derived_quants$Label == "Recr_Virgin",2]),2)`  (Figure \ref{fig:r0-profile}).  The estimate of $R_0$ was informed by a relatively consistent signal from length data across fleets.  The most influential source of age data on the estimate of $R_0$ was the \gls{s-wcgbt} which supported higher values of $R_0$. 


### Retrospective Analysis

A ten-year retrospective analysis was conducted by peeling off years of data ranging from 2010 - 2019 (i.e., "Data -1 Years" corresponds to data through 2019). The estimated spawning output was generally consistent with the base model when recent years of data were removed (Figures \ref{fig:retro-ssb} and \ref{fig:retro-depl}). As data years were subsequently removed the overall stock scale declined with the largest drops in stock size and status estimates occurring after 9 or 10 years of recent data were removed.

### Historical Analysis

The estimated spawning output from previous assessments since 2001 are shown in Figure \ref{fig:past-assess}. The estimate of stock scale from the base model is considerably lower relative to the 2011 assessment estimate which was highly uncertain. The base model $SB0$ was nearly identical to the value estimated in 2005 but diverged between 1960-2005. The relative stock status of the base model was relatively consistent in trend and scale with the estimate from the 2011 assessment.

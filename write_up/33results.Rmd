## Base Model Results

The base model parameter estimates along with approximate asymptotic standard errors are shown in Table \ref{tab:params} and the likelihood components are shown in Table \ref{tab:likes}. Estimates of derived reference points and approximate 95% asymptotic confidence intervals are shown in Table \ref{tab:referenceES}. Estimates of stock size over time are shown in Table \ref{tab:timeseries}. 

### Parameter Estimates

There are numerous types of data for which the fits are discussed: survey abundance indices, discard data (biomass and length compositions), length-composition data for the fisheries and surveys, marginal age compositions for the fisheries and surveys, and conditional age-at-length observations for the surveys.

The fits to the survey indices are shown in FigureXX.  Extra standard error was estimated for the \gls{s-tri}, \gls{s-nwslope}, and \gls{s-aslope}.

## Base Model Results

The base model parameter estimates along with approximate asymptotic standard errors are shown in Table \ref{tab:params} and the likelihood components are shown in Table \ref{tab:likes}. Estimates of derived reference points and approximate 95 percent asymptotic confidence intervals are shown in Table \ref{tab:referenceES}. Estimates of stock size over time are shown in Table \ref{tab:timeseries}. 

### Parameter Estimates

Natural mortality for males was estimated as a relative offset from the fixed female value within the model.  Natural mortality was estimated to be `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "NatM_p_1_Fem_GP_1", 3]*exp(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "NatM_p_1_Mal_GP_1", 3]),3)` yr^-1^ for male fish and fixed at `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "NatM_p_1_Fem_GP_1", 3],3)` yr^-1^ for female fish.  The female value reflects the median of the prior.  

The estimates of growth parameters by sex varied relative to the externally estimated starting values.  The length at age 1 and the maximum length estimates for both sexes was slightly less than the external estimates but were well within the 95 percent confidence interval given the estimated uncertainty (Table \ref{tab:params} and Figure \ref{fig:mod-est-len-age}). The estimated $k$ for female and male fish were greater than the values estimated externally using only available survey data (`r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "VonBert_K_Fem_GP_1", 3],3)` yr^-1^ for females and `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "VonBert_K_Fem_GP_1", 3]*exp(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "VonBert_K_Mal_GP_1", 3]),3)` yr^-1^ for males).  The majority of growth for female and male `r spp` growth occurs at younger ages, reaching near maximum length by age 20-25, depending upon sex, with female `r spp` reaching  larger maximum lengths (Figure \ref{fig:mod-est-len-age}). 

Selectivity curves were estimated for the fishery and survey fleets by sex.  The estimated selectivities are shown in Figure \ref{fig:selex}. The selectivity for both commercial fleets (California and Oregon/Washington) were parameterized using the double-normal selectivity where female selectivity was estimated as an offset from males. Dome-shape selectivity using the double-normal flexible parameterization was explore for each of these fleets by sex were during model development. The best fit to the California length data by sex was achieved with a male asymptotic selectivity and a dome-shaped selectivity for females less than 1.0.  The selectivity for the Oregon/Washington fleet was estimated to be dome-shaped for both sexes with maximum female selectivity being less than 1.0. The selectivity for both commercial fleets shifted rightward or leftward by blocked years, likely driven by management or fishery changes across time.

The selectivity of the \gls{s-tri} and the \gls{s-wcgbt} in the base model were estimated using the double-normal parameterization, allowing for dome-shaped selectivity. Females selectivity were estimated as offsets from the male selectivity parameters. The \gls{s-tri} which surveyed depths 55 - 549 meters, only a subset of the depth range of `r spp`, had peak selectivity for both sexes around 30 cm and reduced selectivity for larger sizes where maximum female selectivity was less than 1.0. The \gls{s-wcgbt} which samples a wide range of depths (55 -1280 m) had the highest female selectivity across sizes but maximum selectivity was still less than 1.0.  The two slope survey selectivities, \gls{s-aslope} and \gls{s-nwslope}, that focused sampling at deeper depths were parameterized using a cubic spline function with allows for bimodal selectivity. 

The estimated retention curves for each commercial fleet based on the historical time blocks and discarded length composition data are shown in Figure \ref{fig:retention}. The earliest retention curve for California, 1911-1947, was fixed left skewed for full retention since the input catches for this period included estimates of discard mortality.  The retention curves for both commercial fleets since the start of the ITQ fishery have shifted leftward indicating very limited discarding. 

The catchability for each of the surveys was analytically solved comparing observed to expected vulnerable biomass across all years.  The catchabiltiy for the \gls{s-tri} was `r round(exp(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "LnQ_base_Triennial(4)", 3]), 3)` and `r round(exp(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "LnQ_base_Triennial(4)", 3])*exp(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "LnQ_base_Triennial(4)_BLK4add_1995", 3]), 3)` for the early and late periods, respectively.  The catchability for the \gls{s-aslope} and the \gls{s-nwslope} was `r round(exp(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "Q_extraSD_AFSC_Slope(3)", 3]), 3)` and `r round(exp(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "Q_extraSD_NWFSC_Slope(5)", 3]), 3)` respectively. The \gls{s-wcgbt} catchability was `r round(exp(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "LnQ_base_NWFSC_WCGBT(6)", 3]), 3)`. 

Additional survey variability, process error added directly to each year's input standard deviation for the \gls{s-tri}, both early and late, the \gls{s-aslope}, and the \gls{s-nwslope} was estimated within the model.  The model estimated a large added variance of `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "Q_extraSD_Triennial(4)", 3], 3)` for the \gls{s-tri}.
The added variance estimate for both of the slope surveys were similar at `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "Q_extraSD_AFSC_Slope(3)", 3], 3)` and `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "Q_extraSD_NWFSC_Slope(5)", 3], 3)`. No added variance was estimated for the \gls{s-wcgbt}.

The time-series of estimated recruitments and annual recruitment deviations are shown in Figures \ref{fig:recruits} and \ref{fig:rec-devs}). The highest recruitment is estimated to have occurred in 2000 and 2009 with the lowest recruitment between 2003 - 2005. There is little information regarding recruitment prior to 1970 but are estimated in the base model to account for uncertainty the unfished condition. Estimated recruitment deviations during years with the majority of the compostional data, after 1980, have relatively high uncertainty intervals indicating lack of support for clear strong or poor recruitment across data sources. Recruitment deviations after 2015 are relatively uninformed with estimated deviations near zero where recruitment is estimated primarily based on the spawner-recruit curve (Figure \ref{fig:bh-curve}). The recruitment bias adjustment applied within the model across years is shown in Figure \ref{fig:bias-adj}.

### Fits to the Data

The fits to the survey indices are shown in Figure \ref{fig:wcgbt-index-fit} - \ref{fig:nwslope-index-fit}.  Extra standard error was estimated for the \gls{s-tri}, \gls{s-nwslope}, and \gls{s-aslope}.

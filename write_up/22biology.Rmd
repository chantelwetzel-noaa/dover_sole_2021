## Biological Data

### Natural Mortality

Natural mortality is a parameter that is often highly uncertain in fish stocks.  There are no current published estimates of natural mortality, aside from what has been used in previous assessments which were based upon maximum ages.  Assessments of `r spp` in off the West Coast in 1997 and 2005 both fixed this parameter at 0.09 yr^-1^ for both males and females [@brodziak_assessment_1997; @sampson_status_2005] which resulted in 0.1% of `r spp` surviving to age 48 years in an unexploited stock, which was considered consistent with observed older ages.  The 2011 assessment estimate natural mortality at 0.117 yr^-1^ for females and 0.142 yr^-1^ for males [@hicks_status_2011]. 

Hamel [-@hamel_method_2015] developed a method for combining meta-analytic approaches relating the $M$ rate to other life-history parameters such as longevity, size, growth rate, and reproductive effort to provide a prior on $M$. In that same issue of *ICES Journal of Marine Science*, Then et al. [-@then_evaluating_2015] provided an updated data set of estimates of $M$ and related life history parameters across a large number of fish species from which to develop an $M$ estimator for fish species in general. They concluded by recommending $M$ estimates be based on maximum age alone, based on an updated Hoenig non-linear least squares estimator $M = 4.899A^{-0.916}_{max}$. The approach of basing $M$ priors on maximum age alone was one that was already being used for West Coast rockfish assessments. However, in fitting the alternative model forms relating $M$ to $A_{\text{max}}$, Then et al. [-@then_evaluating_2015] did not consistently apply their transformation. In particular, in real space, one would expect substantial heteroscedasticity in both the observation and process error associated with the observed relationship of $M$ to $A_{\text{max}}$. Therefore, it would be reasonable to fit all models under a log transformation. This was not done. Re-evaluating the data used in Then et al. [-@then_evaluating_2015] by fitting the one-parameter $A_{\text{max}}$ model under a log-log transformation (such that the slope is forced to be -1 in the transformed space [@hamel_method_2015]), the point estimate for $M$ is:

\begin{centering}

$M=\frac{5.4}{A_{\text{max}}}$

\end{centering}

The above is also the median of the prior. The prior is defined as a lognormal distribution with mean $ln(5.4/A_{\text{max}})$ and standard error = 0.438.  The maximum age was selected based on available age data from all West Coast data sources. The oldest aged `r spp` was 69 years, captured by the commercial fishery in 1989. Examining all aged fish a maximum age of 50 was selected. Across all data sources there were limited observation greater than 50 years of age (79 observations in total). In the fish that have been aged from the \Gls{s-wcgbt} there have been 41 observations of fish greater that 50 years old (25 females and 16 males). There was little support for a sex-specific differences in maximim age. However, age data are subject to ageing error which could impact this estimate of longevity.  

Using a maximum age of 50, the median of the prior was 0.108 yr^-1^ with an standard error of 0.48, the default value of the Hamel [-@hamel_method_2015] method.
  

### Maturation and Fecundity

Estimates of maturity at length and age have been variable between studies.  Hagerman [-@hagerman_biology_1952] reported that 50 percent of 35 cm female `r spp` were mature with all mature at a length of 45 cm.  Yoklovich and Pikitch [-@yoklavich_reproductive_1989] reported a smaller size at 50% mature.  Hunter et al. [-@hunter_fecundity_1992] reported that different collection times and methods of analysis resulted in different estimates of maturity at length and suggest that differences reported between Hagerman [-@hagerman_biology_1952] and Yoklavich and Pikitch [-@yoklavich_reproductive_1989] may have been due these differences rather than changes in maturity.  Brodziak and Mikus [-@brodziak_variation_2000] found significant north-south differences in maturity curves derived for INPFC areas, with fish maturing at smaller sizes in the north.  Their estimate of length at 50 percent maturity was less than 35 cm, as reported by Hagerman [-@hagerman_biology_1952].

The maturity-at-length assumed in this assessment was based on new `r spp` maturity reads conducted by Melissa Head (NOAA, NWFSC) examining a total of 428 samples collected by the \Gls{s-wcgbt} survey. The 50 percent size-at-maturity was estimated at `r round(model$MGparmAdj[,"Mat50%_Fem_GP_1"][1], 1)` cm and slope of `r round(model$MGparmAdj$Mat_slope_Fem_GP_1[1], 2)` with maturity asymptoting to 1.0 for larger fish. The shape of the new maturity-at-length and a comparison to the maturity curve used in the 2011 assessment is shown in Figure \ref{fig:compare-mat-at-len}. The new maturity-at-length curve was based on the estimate of functional maturity, an approach that classifies maturity with developing oocytes as mature or immature based on the proportion of vitellogenin in the cytoplasm and the measured frequency of atretic cells (Melissa Head, personal communication, NWFSC, NOAA). 

Maturity-at-length was examined spatially splitting `r spp` samples into north and south of Point Reyes off the California coast (approximately 38\textdegree 0\textquotesingle N. Lat.).  Spatial difference in life history traits is commonly observed in groundfish species off the West Coast.  The northern group had 334 maturity samples with 94 maturity samples in the southern group. The estimated length at 50 percent maturity were significantly different for fish in the north and south, with fish in the south maturing at larger sizes (39.84 cm) relative to fish in the north (31.23 cm, Figure \ref{fig:spat-mat-at-len}). These results are consistent in trend with those from Brodziak and Mikus [-@brodziak_variation_2000] who also determined that fish in the north appear to mature at smaller sizes relative to fish in the south.  The size and age of fish observed in shallower depths (less than 400 m) varies between the north and south (Figure \ref{fig:samples-north-south}). In the north a wide range of sizes and ages are observed at shallower depths, while only younger and smaller fish are observed at shallower depths in the south. This pattern in sizes and age are also apparent when looking at all observations of `r spp` by the \gls{s-wcgbt} (Figure \ref{fig:fish-by-lat}) with a distinct break in observations around San Francisco, just south of Point Reyes. The mechanisms leading to these differences across the coast are unclear. This maturity analysis only evaluated data on a coastwide basic or split into two areas, future work should be done to determine if differences in maturity slowly changes across latitude vs. distinct changes by area.    

This assessment did not account for these spatial differences in maturity and assumed a homogenous population structure for `r spp` off the West Coast due to challenges in the ability to split data by area combined with the uncertain spatial migration patterns off `r spp` off the West Coast. Future analsysis should be conducted to further understand potential patterns in life history traits across the coast combined with tagging studies which could provide insight in movement.    

Fecundity is related to size. Yoklavich and Pikitch [-@yoklavich_reproductive_1989] estimated fecundity of `r spp` off the Oregon coast reporting that 40 cm female produce about 40,000 oocytes and a 55 cm female produceabout 160,000 oocytes.  Hunter et al. [-@hunter_fecundity_1992] estimated the fecundity of `r spp` samples off the coasts of Oregon and California and found no statistical difference in the fecundity by area and estimated no statistical difference in Oregon between their results and those from Yoklavich and Pikitch [-@yoklavich_reproductive_1989].

The relationship of fecundity to weight concluded by Yoklavich and Pikitch [-@yoklavich_reproductive_1989] was nearly linear when translated from length to weight. Based on the work of Yoklavich and Pikitch [-@yoklavich_reproductive_1989] fecundity was assumed to be equal to weight in this assessment. 


### Length-Weight Relationship

Weight-at-length data collected by the \Gls{s-wcgbt} was used to externally estimate weight-length relationship for both sexes of `r spp`.  Weight-at-length was generally similar between females and males (Figure \ref{fig:est-len-wght}).  Males were estimated to weigh more at the larger lengths (>40cm) compared to females.  However, the majority of observations of fish greater than 50cm are predominated by female fish because males generally do not tend to grow as large in comparison. The following estimate of the weight-at-length relationship was used by sex in this assessment:

\begin{centering}

Females: $\alpha$ = `r format(model$MGparmAdj$Wtlen_1_Fem[1], scientific = TRUE, digits = 2)`; $\beta$ = `r round(model$MGparmAdj$Wtlen_2_Fem[1], 2)`

Males: $\alpha$ = `r format(model$MGparmAdj$Wtlen_1_Mal[1], scientific = TRUE, digits = 2)`; $\beta$ = `r round(model$MGparmAdj$Wtlen_2_Mal[1], 2)`

\end{centering}

where weight is measured in grams and length in cm.

### Growth (Length-at-Age)

The length-at-age was estimated for male and female `r spp` using data collected from the \Gls{s-wcgbt} survey. Figure \ref{fig:est-len-at-age} shows the lengths and ages for all years and all data as well as predicted von Bertalanffy fits to the data. Females grow larger reaching a maximum around 45 cm, while males reach maximum size around 40 cm. However, there is considerable variation in length-at-age for both sexes. 

Brodziak and Mikus [-@brodziak_variation_2000] reported differences in growth curves between some INPFC areas using data collected on the continental slope (183 – 1280 m).  Using data collected during the \Gls{s-wcgbt} (55 – 1280m) variation in length-at-age was investigated for four different regions along the coast: south of Point Conception, north of Point Conception to California Oregon border, Oregon, and Washington.  Figure \ref{fig:est-len-at-age-region} shows the differences between female and male growth curves in each of these areas. The $L_{\infty}$ for males south of Point Conception was the largest of the areas, although the differences in maximum size were relatively small. The diffference is sizes for females was also minimal, with females generally reaching larger sizes in the northern areas. 

Coastwide sex-specific growth parameters were externally estimated at the following values:

\begin{centering}

Females $L_{\infty}$ = ; $L1$ = ; $k$ = 

Males $L_{\infty}$ = ;  $L1$ = ; $k$ =  

\end{centering}

These values were used as starting parameter values within the base model prior to estimating each parameter for male and female `r spp`.


### Sex Ratio

The percentage of females showed interesting patterns with depth.  First, because males grow to a smaller size, the proportion of females at intermediate lengths is less than 50%, and is 100% at larger lengths (Figure \ref{fig:sex-by-len}).  This interplays with the pattern of larger fish in deeper water and results in fewer females at intermediate depths (250-750 m) and nearly all females in the deepest depths (Figure \ref{fig:fem-by-lat-depth}).  Sex ratio was slightly variable over latitude but showed no specific pattern (Figure \ref{fig:fem-by-lat-depth}).


### Ageing Precision and Bias

Uncertainty surrounding the age-reading error process for `r spp` was incorporated by estimating ageing error by age. Age-composition data used in the model were from break-and-burn otolith reads. In the early years of data age reads based on scales were available, however, after examining the distribution of ages by length there were concerns about the potential bias in these data (Figure \ref{fig:scale-age}). These age reads were not used in the base model and were not used in the 2005 or 2011 assessments of `r spp`.  

Aged `r spp` used in the assessement we aged by either the Cooperative Ageing Project (CAP) in Newport, Oregon or the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW).  Within lab ageing error was estimated for both CAP and CDFW. Break-and-burn double reads of more than 8,000 otoliths were provided by the CAP lab (unpublished data) and 160 double reads from CDFW (unpublished data).  An ageing error estimate was made based on these double reads using a computational tool specifically developed for estimating ageing error [@punt_quantifying_2008] and using release 1.1.0 of the R package \href{https://github.com/nwfsc-assess/nwfscAgeingError}{nwfscAgeingError} [@thorson_nwfscageingerror:_2012] for input and output diagnostics. A linear standard error was estimated by age where there is more variability in the age of older fish (Figure \ref{fig:age-error}).  Otoliths collected by each survey, Oregon, and Washington commercial data were read by the CAP ageing lab. Otoliths collected from the California commercial fishery were aged by CDFW.

## Fishery-Independent Data

Data from four research surveys have been used in this assessment to provide fishery-independent information about the abundance, distribution, and biological characteristics of `r spp`.  A coast-wide survey was conducted in 1980 [@gunderson_distribution_1980] and repeated every three years through 2004 (referred to as the \gls{s-tri}).  Two slope surveys have been conducted off the West Coast in recent years, one using the research vessel R/V _Miller Freeman_, which ended in 2001 (referred to as the \gls{s-aslope}) and another ongoing cooperative survey using commercial fishing vessels which began in 1998 as a DTS (`r spp`, longspine thornyhead, shortspine thornyhead, and sablefish) survey and was expanded to other groundfish in 1999 (referred to as the \gls{s-nwslope}). In 2003, this survey was expanded spatially to include the shelf off the U.S. West Coast. This last survey, conducted by the NWFSC continues to cover depths from 30-700 fathoms (55-1280 meters) on an annual basis (referred to as the \gls{s-wcgbt}).

### \acrlong{s-wcgbt}

The \Gls{s-wcgbt} is based on a random-grid design; covering the coastal waters from a depth of 55-1,280 m [@bradburn_2003_2011]. This design generally uses four industry-chartered vessels per year assigned to a roughly equal number of randomly selected grid cells and divided into two 'passes' of the coast. Two vessels fish from north to south during each pass between late May to early October. This design therefore incorporates both vessel-to-vessel differences in catchability, as well as variance associated with selecting a relatively small number (approximately 700) of possible cells from a very large set of possible cells spread from the Mexican to the Canadian borders.

### \acrlong{s-tri}

The \gls{s-tri} was first conducted by the \gls{afsc} in 1977, and the survey continued until 2004 [@weinberg_2001_2002]. Its basic design was a series of equally-spaced east-to-west transects across the continential shelf from which searches for tows in a specific depth range were initiated. The survey design changed slightly over time. In general, all of the surveys were conducted in the mid summer through early fall. The 1977 survey was conducted from early July through late September. The surveys from 1980 through 1989 were conducted from mid-July to late September. The 1992 survey was conducted from mid July through early October. The 1995 survey was conducted from early June through late August. The 1998 survey was conducted from early June through early August. Finally, the 2001 and 2004 surveys were conducted from May to July.

Haul depths ranged from 91-457 m during the 1977 survey with no hauls shallower than 91 m. Due to haul performance issues and truncated sampling with respect to depth, the data from 1977 were omitted from this analysis. The surveys in 1980, 1983, and 1986 covered the US West Coast south to 36.8\textdegree N latitude and a depth range of 55-366 m. The surveys in 1989 and 1992 covered the same depth range but extended the southern range to 34.5\textdegree N (near Point Conception). From 1995 through 2004, the surveys covered the depth range 55-500 m and surveyed south to 34.5\textdegree N. In 2004, the final year of the \gls{s-tri} series, the \gls{nwfsc} \gls{fram} conducted the survey following similar protocols to earlier years.

### \acrlong{s-aslope}

The \gls{s-aslope} operated during the months of October to November aboard the R/V _Miller Freeman_. Partial survey coverage of the US west coast occurred during the years 1988-1996 and complete coverage (north of 34\textdegree 30\textquotesingle S) during the years 1997 and 1999-2001. Typically, only these four years that are seen as complete surveys are included in assessments.

### \acrlong{s-nwslope}

The \gls{s-nwslope} covered waters throughout the summer from 183 m to 1,280 m North of latitude $34^\circ 30^\prime$ N., which is near Point Conception, from 1999 and 2002.

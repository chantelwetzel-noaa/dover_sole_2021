The model estimated uncertainty around the `r endyr+1` spawning biomass was $\sigma$ = `r round(model$Pstar_sigma,2)` and the uncertainty around the OFL was $\sigma$ = `r round(model$OFL_sigm, 2)`. This is likely an underestimate of overall uncertainty because of the necessity to fix several population dynamic parameters (e.g., steepness, recruitment variance, female natural mortality) and no explicit incorporation of model structural uncertainty (although see the decision table for alternative states of nature).
